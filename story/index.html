    <p class="lead">For the past couple of weeks, we had been packing up the apartment for our move to our new home. That morning, Nora asked Bernie to go through his boxes of memorabilia and letters from his exes. (I know, I can't believe Bernie still had them! -___-)</p>
    <p class="lead">Bernie had the ring for about 2 months, and kept asking to eat somewhere nice in Laguna, and he would make reservations. That morning, he still did not make reservations. Luckily, Mastro's had a slot open at 7:30 for dinner.</p>

    <p class="lead">While getting dolled up, I hear Bernie shouting, "Where is my jackets! Did you pack my jackets?!" I nodded. "I told you not to pack stuff we still need!" I shouted back, "Do you really want to get into an argument over a jacket, right before a nice dinner?" He stopped yelling and found a dinky sweater to carry. Which he didn't even wear that night!</p>

    <p class="lead">We arrived at Mastro's and got seated. The waiter came and asked if we were celebrating something special. Bernie started to giggle and had the biggest smile ever... sort of creepy in a way, and I told the waiter that we were celebrating Bernie's job.</p>

    <p class="lead">We got home and I ran to the restroom... Too much water. And as I came out, I saw Bernie trying to hide something under the bed. After 10 minutes of pestering him about what he was doing, he finally went into the bedroom and came out to propose with the ring.</p>
    <p class="lead">I said <strong>yes</strong>, we went to bed.</p>
    <p class="lead">... Yeah right! We called our families and friends!</p>
